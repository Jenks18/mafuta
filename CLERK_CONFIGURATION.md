# üö® CLERK CONFIGURATION REQUIRED

## The Problem You're Seeing:
When clicking "Sign in with Google", you're redirected to `your_project.supabase.co/auth/v1/authorize?provider=google`

This is **WRONG**. Your app uses **Clerk** for authentication, not Supabase Auth.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

1. **Supabase is ONLY for database**, not authentication
2. **Clerk handles ALL authentication** (email, Google, etc.)
3. The error you saw is because Clerk was misconfigured
4. After fixing Clerk settings, the Supabase error will disappear
