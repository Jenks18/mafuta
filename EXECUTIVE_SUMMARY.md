## 🔐 Security Model

### 3-Layer Security:

**Layer 1: Authentication (Clerk)**
- Who are you?
- Handles signup, login, sessions
- Issues JWT tokens

**Layer 2: Permission Checks (App Logic)**
- What UI should you see?
- Role-based component rendering
- Frontend validation

**Layer 3: Authorization (Supabase RLS)**
- What data can you access?
- Database-level enforcement
- Cannot be bypassed by frontend modifications

**Result:** Enterprise-grade security with complete data isolation.

## 🎭 User Roles Explained

### Fleet Roles (B2B)

| Role | Can Do |
|------|--------|
| **Fleet Admin** 👑 | Everything - manage company, vehicles, users |
| **Fleet Manager** 📊 | Manage vehicles, approve transactions, view reports |
| **Driver** 🚗 | Record fuel purchases, view assigned vehicle |
| **Accountant** 💰 | View financials, export reports (read-only) |
| **Dispatcher** 📍 | Plan routes, assign vehicles |

### Individual Roles (B2C)

| Role | Features |
|------|----------|
| **Consumer** | Free tier - basic features |
| **Premium** | Paid tier - advanced analytics, alerts |
| **Business** | Small business owner features |

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: ABC Logistics (Fleet Customer)

**Setup:**
- Company: ABC Logistics Inc.
- Fleet: 50 trucks
- Users:
  - 1 Fleet Admin (owner)
  - 2 Fleet Managers
  - 1 Accountant
  - 50 Drivers

**Daily Use:**
1. Driver fills up truck → Records transaction
2. Transaction goes to "Pending Approval"
3. Manager reviews → Approves transaction
4. Accountant exports monthly report
5. Admin reviews spending analytics

**Data Isolation:**
- ABC Logistics sees ONLY their 50 trucks
- Cannot see XYZ Trucking's vehicles
- RLS enforces at database level

---

### Example 2: Sarah (Individual Consumer)

**Setup:**
- User: Sarah Thompson
- Vehicle: 2020 Honda Civic
- Subscription: Premium ($9.99/mo)

**Daily Use:**
1. Opens app → Sees nearby gas stations
2. Finds cheapest Shell at $3.45/gal
3. Uses digital card to pay
4. Earns 5% cashback ($2.17)
5. Gets alert when prices drop

**Data Privacy:**
- Sarah sees ONLY her transactions
- No company affiliation
- Personal rewards account

---

## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. Unified User Table
Single `users` table for both fleet and individual:
- `account_type` discriminator ('fleet' | 'individual')
- Fleet users have `company_id`
- Individual users have `company_id = NULL`

### 2. Shared Transaction Table
Same `fuel_transactions` table for both:
- Fleet: Filtered by `company_id`
- Individual: Filtered by `user_id`
- RLS handles access automatically

### 3. Smart Onboarding
Auto-detects account type and routes appropriately:
- Fleet → Collect company info, assign role
- Individual → Collect preferences, create card

### 4. Permission Abstraction
Simple helper functions:
```javascript
hasFleetPermission(role, 'canAddVehicle')
hasIndividualPermission(role, 'canAccessPremium')
```

---

## 📊 Scalability

### Current State
- ✅ Single database
- ✅ RLS for isolation
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ React frontend

### Can Handle
- **Users:** 10,000+
- **Companies:** 1,000+
- **Vehicles:** 100,000+
- **Transactions:** Millions

### Future Scaling
- Add read replicas (Supabase)
- CDN for assets (Cloudflare)
- Caching layer (Redis)
- Microservices (if needed)

**But start simple!** Current architecture scales far.
