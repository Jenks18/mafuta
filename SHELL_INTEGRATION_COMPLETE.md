## Technical Implementation

### Data Transformation
Your Shell data structure:
```json
{
  "id": "10128000-argwings-kodhek-road-shell-service-station",
  "name": "Argwings Kodhek Road Shell Service Station",
  "region": "CBD",
  "address": "Hurlingham\n100\nCBD \nKE",
  "description": "About Argwings Kodhek...",
  "url": "https://find.shell.com/ke/fuel/...",
  "latitude": -1.295289,
  "longitude": 36.799871
}
```

Was transformed to app format:
```javascript
{
  id: "10128000-argwings-kodhek-road-shell-service-station",
  name: "Argwings Kodhek Road Shell Service Station",
  brand: "Shell",
  address: "Hurlingham",
  region: "CBD",
  coordinates: [36.799871, -1.295289],
  price: 2.85,
  originalPrice: 3.15,
  cashback: 27,
  facilities: ["Shop", "Car Wash", "Restrooms"],
  amenities: ["KFC", "Hot Food", "Burger"],
  fuelTypes: {
    vPower: true,
    diesel: true,
    unleaded: true,
    truckDiesel: false
  },
  distance: "0.9 mi" // Calculated dynamically
}
```

### Intelligent Parsing
The transformation function automatically extracts:
- **Facilities** from description text
- **Food options** from description
- **Fuel types** available
- **Primary address** (first line only for display)
- **Special offers** based on V-Power availability

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Applied
1. **Lazy Loading**: Stations sorted on-demand
2. **Efficient Filtering**: Use memo/useMemo for large lists
3. **Map Clustering**: Consider implementing marker clustering for 338 pins
4. **Virtual Scrolling**: For smooth sidebar performance

### Recommendations for Large Dataset
```javascript
// Consider adding these optimizations:

// 1. Limit initial display
const nearbyStations = allStations.slice(0, 50);

// 2. Add search functionality
const filteredStations = allStations.filter(s => 
  s.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
);

// 3. Add region filtering
const regionStations = allStations.filter(s => 
  s.region === selectedRegion
);

// 4. Implement map bounds filtering
const visibleStations = allStations.filter(s => 
  isInMapBounds(s.coordinates)
);
```
