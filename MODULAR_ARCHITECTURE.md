# Mafuta Fuel Management Platform - Modular Architecture

## Overview
Successfully refactored the monolithic React application into a fully modular, enterprise-grade fuel management platform with responsive design and clean component architecture.

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### 1. **Main App Structure**
- **Before**: Single large `App.jsx` with inline components (724 lines)
- **After**: Clean `App.jsx` (80 lines) with modular imports and switch-based routing

### 2. **Component Organization**
