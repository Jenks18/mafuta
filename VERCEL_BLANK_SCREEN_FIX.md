# üöÄ VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - BLANK SCREEN FIX

## ‚úÖ What I've Fixed in Code:
1. ‚úÖ Added `vercel.json` configuration
2. ‚úÖ Added `.env.production` template
3. ‚úÖ Added Error Boundary to catch runtime errors
4. ‚úÖ Verified build works locally (`npm run build` succeeded)
5. ‚úÖ No hardcoded localhost URLs in source code
6. ‚úÖ All changes pushed to GitHub

## üîß CRITICAL: Vercel Environment Variables

The blank screen is **100% caused by missing environment variables on Vercel**.

### Go to Vercel Dashboard:
1. Open: https://vercel.com/
2. Click on your project: **raty-rsjf** (or mafuta)
3. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**

### Add These 4 Variables:

#### Variable 1:
```
Name: VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
Value: pk_test_cGxlYXNhbnQtbWFsbGFyZC05NS5jbGVyay5hY2NvdW50cy5kZXYk
Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all 3)
```

#### Variable 2:
```
Name: VITE_SUPABASE_URL
Value: https://epyybtyguntyamvgpbuz.supabase.co
Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all 3)
```

#### Variable 3:
```
Name: VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Value: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImVweXlidHlndW50eWFtdmdwYnV6Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjAxNjU2NDAsImV4cCI6MjA3NTc0MTY0MH0.4lBb0M6ogJCNE_AEjPcTDfQFMjCMW7ElGXcXXZFj1SQ
Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all 3)
```

#### Variable 4:
```
Name: VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN
Value: pk.eyJ1IjoieWF6enlqZW5rcyIsImEiOiJjbWU2b2o0eXkxNDFmMm1vbGY3dWt5aXViIn0.8hEu3t-bv3R3kGsBb_PIcw
Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all 3)
```

## üîÑ After Adding Environment Variables:

### Option 1: Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
Vercel will automatically redeploy when it detects the new environment variables.

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click the **‚ãØ** menu on the latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**

---

## üß™ How to Verify It's Fixed:

1. **Wait for deployment to complete** (1-2 minutes)
2. **Open your Vercel URL**: https://raty-rsjf.vercel.app
3. **You should see**:
   - ‚úÖ Green gradient background
   - ‚úÖ "Mafuta" logo with fuel pump emoji
   - ‚úÖ Clerk sign-in form
   - ‚ùå NOT a blank white screen

4. **If still blank**, press `F12` (or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac):
   - Go to **Console** tab
   - Look for "üîë Environment Check" message
   - Check if `hasClerkKey: true` or `false`
   - Share any red error messages you see

---

## üìã Quick Checklist:

- [ ] Added all 4 environment variables on Vercel
- [ ] Selected all 3 environments (Production, Preview, Development)
- [ ] Triggered redeploy
- [ ] Waited for deployment to finish
- [ ] Tested the URL
- [ ] Checked browser console for errors

---

## üÜò If Still Not Working:

### Check Build Logs:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab in Vercel
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click **View Build Logs**
4. Look for any errors mentioning environment variables

### Common Issues:
- ‚ùå **Typo in variable names** - Must be EXACTLY as shown above
- ‚ùå **Not selected all environments** - Must check all 3 boxes
- ‚ùå **Old deployment cached** - Force redeploy
- ‚ùå **Browser cache** - Try incognito mode or clear cache

---

## üí° Why This Happened:

Vite environment variables (prefixed with `VITE_`) are embedded during **build time**, not runtime.

If the variables aren't set in Vercel's Environment Variables settings, the build will succeed but the app will have `undefined` for all those values, causing:
- Clerk to not initialize (blank screen)
- Supabase to not connect
- Mapbox to not load

This is why it works locally (you have `.env.local`) but not on Vercel!

---

## ‚úÖ Final Check:

After adding the variables and redeploying, open:
https://raty-rsjf.vercel.app

You should see the Clerk login screen with the green Mafuta theme!
