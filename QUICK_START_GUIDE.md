## 🎨 Example: Add New Fleet Page

1. **Create component:**
```jsx
// src/pages/fleet/VehiclesPage.jsx
export default function VehiclesPage() {
  const [vehicles, setVehicles] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetch() {
      const supabase = useAuthenticatedSupabase();
      const { data } = await supabase
        .from('vehicles')
        .select('*')
        .order('vehicle_number');
      setVehicles(data);
    }
    fetch();
  }, []);

  return <div>Vehicle list here</div>;
}
```

2. **Add route:**
```jsx
// In App.jsx
<Route path="fleet/vehicles" element={<VehiclesPage />} />
```

3. **Add navigation:**
```jsx
<Link to="/fleet/vehicles">Vehicles</Link>
```

Done! RLS automatically filters by company.

## 🔐 Security Features

### ✅ Complete Data Isolation
- Company A **cannot** see Company B's data
- Enforced at database level (RLS)
- Cannot be bypassed by modifying frontend

### ✅ Role-Based Access Control
- Drivers only see assigned vehicles
- Managers approve transactions
- Admins manage company settings

### ✅ Multi-Layer Security
1. **Clerk** - Authentication (who you are)
2. **App Logic** - Permission checks (what UI to show)
3. **Supabase RLS** - Authorization (what data you can access)

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign up as Fleet user
- [ ] Complete fleet onboarding
- [ ] See fleet dashboard
- [ ] Sign up as Individual user (different email)
- [ ] Complete individual onboarding
- [ ] See consumer dashboard
- [ ] Create second fleet company
- [ ] Verify data isolation between companies
- [ ] Test driver can only see assigned vehicle
- [ ] Test manager can approve transactions

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot read property 'account_type' of null"
**Fix:** User not onboarded. Check `OnboardingRouter` redirects correctly.

### Supabase RLS blocking queries
**Fix:** Verify Clerk JWT template includes `sub` claim. Check RLS helper functions.

### Wrong dashboard after login
**Fix:** `ProtectedRoute` auto-redirects. Check user metadata saved correctly.

### Vehicles not showing
**Fix:** Check `assigned_driver_id` matches user ID. Verify RLS policy allows access.

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Multi-Tenancy
One app serves many customers with complete data isolation.

### Account Types
- `fleet` - Business with multiple users/vehicles
- `individual` - Single consumer

### RLS (Row Level Security)
Database policies that automatically filter data based on who's logged in.

### JWT Flow
Clerk generates token → Your app passes to Supabase → RLS uses claims to filter data

## 🎉 You're Ready!

You now have a production-ready multi-tenant architecture that can scale from 10 to 10,000 customers. 

The same codebase serves:
- ✅ Enterprise fleet companies (AtoB Fuel style)
- ✅ Individual consumers (Upside style)
- ✅ Everything in between
